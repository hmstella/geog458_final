# Hospitals and Inequalities
#### These days, the importance of hospitals is getting bigger and bigger. This project is going to spot the hospitals in King County, Washington and divide the county into the level of neighborhoods.

You can access the web map through <a href="https://hmstella.github.io/inequalities_of_hospitals">HERE</a> as well.

### :mega: Project Goal
The goal of the project is to see the locations of medical facilities in King County. With the density of medical facilities at the level of neighborhoods, it can be deducted that the accessing hospitals is very dependent on the resident's location. It can be also referred that this uneven distribution may occur some social disparities in races, age groups, and incomes.
